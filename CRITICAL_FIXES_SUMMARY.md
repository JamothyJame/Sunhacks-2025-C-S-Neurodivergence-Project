---

## üéØ Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ 1. UUID Browser Compatibility
**Issue:** Using `crypto.randomUUID()` without fallback for older browsers  
**Fix:** Created comprehensive UUID utility with multiple fallback strategies  
**Files Added:** `src/utils/uuid.ts`  
**Files Modified:** `src/models/Medication.ts`

**Implementation:**
- Native `crypto.randomUUID()` for modern browsers
- `crypto.getRandomValues()` fallback with RFC 4122 compliance  
- Math.random() final fallback for maximum compatibility
- Added UUID validation utility

### ‚úÖ 2. Service Worker Implementation
**Issue:** Missing service worker file referenced in NotificationService  
**Fix:** Created comprehensive service worker with offline support  
**Files Added:** `public/sw.js`

**Implementation:**
- Basic caching strategy for offline functionality
- Background notification handling
- Push notification support with actions
- Offline fallback page with branded UI
- Notification click handling for medication tracking

### ‚úÖ 3. Error Boundary Implementation  
**Issue:** Error boundary created but not used in application  
**Fix:** Implemented and integrated error boundary with custom fallback UI  
**Files Added:** `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`  
**Files Modified:** `src/main.tsx`

**Implementation:**
- Comprehensive error boundary with logging integration
- Custom branded fallback UI for MedTracker
- Error recovery mechanisms (try again, reload page)
- Development-mode error details display
- Higher-order component wrapper utility

### ‚úÖ 4. Input Sanitization System
**Issue:** User inputs not sanitized, potential XSS vulnerabilities  
**Fix:** Created comprehensive sanitization utility system  
**Files Added:** `src/utils/sanitization.ts`  
**Files Modified:** `src/components/AddMedicationForm.tsx`, `src/hooks/useFormValidation.ts`

**Implementation:**
- HTML entity encoding for dangerous characters
- Specialized sanitization for different input types (names, emails, medications, etc.)
- Form data sanitization with field-specific rules
- Deep object sanitization for complex data structures
- Integration with existing form validation system

### ‚úÖ 5. Race Condition Prevention
**Issue:** Concurrent inventory updates causing data inconsistencies  
**Fix:** Implemented atomic operations and mutex locking  
**Files Added:** `src/utils/atomicOperations.ts`  
**Files Modified:** `src/services/InventoryService.ts`

**Implementation:**
- Mutex locking for exclusive resource access
- Operation queuing for sequential execution
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Optimistic locking with version control
- Debounced operations to prevent rapid successive calls

### ‚úÖ 6. Memory Leak Prevention
**Issue:** NotificationService growing unbounded arrays causing memory leaks  
**Fix:** Implemented automatic cleanup and resource management  
**Files Modified:** `src/services/NotificationService.ts`

**Implementation:**
- Periodic cleanup of expired notifications (5-minute intervals)
- Maximum notification limits (100 active notifications)
- Automatic cleanup on expired scheduled times
- Memory usage monitoring and statistics
- Resource cleanup on app shutdown

### ‚úÖ 7. Data Import Validation
**Issue:** JSON import without validation could corrupt database  
**Fix:** Comprehensive data validation and sanitization for imports  
**Files Modified:** `src/services/IndexedDBService.ts`

**Implementation:**
- JSON structure validation before processing
- Type-specific validation for all data entities
- Data sanitization with date parsing and field validation
- Detailed import reporting with success/failure counts
- Graceful handling of invalid data (skip with warnings)

### ‚úÖ 8. Configurable Notification Throttling
**Issue:** Hardcoded 24-hour notification throttling  
**Fix:** Made throttling configurable through user preferences  
**Files Modified:** `src/types/index.ts`, `src/services/InventoryService.ts`, `src/models/UserModel.ts`

**Implementation:**
- Added `throttleHours` and `refillReminderDays` to UserPreferences
- Updated InventoryService to use user-configurable throttling
- Default settings maintained while allowing customization
- Backward compatibility for existing users

### ‚úÖ 9. Improved Timezone Handling
**Issue:** Browser timezone used without user confirmation  
**Fix:** Added timezone selection to user preferences  
**Files Modified:** `src/types/index.ts`, `src/services/UserService.ts`, `src/models/UserModel.ts`

**Implementation:**
- Added `timezone` field to UserPreferences
- Browser timezone detection as smart default
- User can override timezone in preferences
- Timezone used for accurate medication scheduling
