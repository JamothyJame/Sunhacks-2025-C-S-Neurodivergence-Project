# Sunhacks-2025-C-S-Neurodivergence-Project


**Inspiration**

Our team, James Obergh and Chandler Rosson, have dealt with the frustrations of medication and the ever tedious struggle of mental health. We want to help support neurodivergent people THEIR way.

**What it does**

A simple web-app/ios app which gamifies the medication system, including tracking your medications and giving a seamless integration between Google Gemini's help and a professional medical database of information. We also developed a prototype wearable device which a user can easily input medication times and have an alarm at such a time. The device works even when not powered (through an RTC module on the arduino).

**How we built it**

We built the web-app/ios app through the warp IDE developer, and is mostly written in java. Developing the goals for both the web-app and hardware component were simple, as they were answers to our personal struggles with ADHD. Firstly, we delineated the necessary features: medication tracker, Google Gemini API, aesthetic UI/UX, and then we focused on pushing towards those goals until we found agreed success.
Challenges we ran into

Some challenges we ran into was committing the web-app to github, as some files were larger than the allowed github file size import, and another, for the hardware component, was not just programming a multitude of timers for the arduino, but also figuring out how to program for a short demo and also show that it can be a long-term device as well.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**

We're proud of serving aesthetic and working products, web-app and wearable. The lack of sleep was difficult, but we pushed through all roadblocks and reached a satisfying conclusion for Sunhacks 25'. We are very proud of the moorse code confirmation design of the wearable, using an active buzzer.

**What we learned**

Take it slow and take it easy is the best thing we learned. Sometimes it is best to step back for a moment and let your mind simmer with your thoughts and rest. There were multiple moments where our progress, software/hardware sides, both felt useless. By focusing on teamwork, and making sure each of us was in the best spirits possible, we realized further and further through that we can figure out anything. And, almost equally as importantly, it is okay to pivot ideas/features!

**What's next for Neuro-Emergent Buddy**

This is a passion project for us more than a hackathon hob-job. We want to continue adding features, making it our own, and truly helping others. Outside of Sunhacks we plan to continue work (making hardware smaller and more comfortable and expanding web-app functionality).
